# 3.6-Supervised-Learning-Potpourri
This collection of Jupyter Notebooks will solve various supervised learning problems.

### Assignment Prompts

1. Credit Card Fraud
  - Use this credit card fraud dataset to develop an algorithm to predict fraud. Prioritize correctly finding fraud rather than correctly labeling non-fraudulent transactions.
  - Please note: as of 3/1/18, the link to the dataset was broken, and I could not complete the assignment.
2. Airline Arrivals
  - Use this dataset of airline arrival information to predict how late flights will be. A flight only counts as late if it is more than 30 minutes late.
3. Amazon Reviews
  - Use one of the following datasets to perform sentiment analysis on the given Amazon reviews. Pick one of the "small" datasets that is a reasonable size for your computer. The goal is to create a model to algorithmically predict if a review is positive or negative just based on its text. Try to see how these reviews compare across categories. Does a review classification model for one category work for another?
4. Housing Prices
  - Using this Kaggle data create a model to predict a house's value. We want to be able to understand what creates value in a house, as though we were a real estate developer.
5. Cancer Diagnostics
  - Using this set of breast cancer data, create a model to predict breast cancer. Also, what traits are most indicative of whether or not an individual will be diagnosed?
